# Midterm Project — Banknote Authentication Classifier

Welcome to my **Midterm Project**, where I apply machine-learning classification techniques to the Banknote Authentication dataset.  
This project evaluates multiple models to determine which classifier best distinguishes authentic banknotes from forged ones.

## 📄 Overview / Summary

In this midterm project, I:

- Loaded and explored the Banknote Authentication dataset  
- Analyzed feature distributions and correlations  
- Built several classification models such as:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree or Random Forest (depending on assignment guidelines)  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and additional metrics  
- Compared strengths and weaknesses of each classifier  
- Reflected on which model performed best and why  

This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine-learning techniques from end to end: exploration → modeling → evaluation → interpretation.
