# Project 03 — Classifier Comparison

Welcome to **Project 03**, where I compare multiple classification models to understand performance differences and model behavior.  
This project builds on Projects 01 and 02 by evaluating models more rigorously and interpreting their strengths and weaknesses.

## 📄 Overview / Summary

In this project, I:

- Loaded and prepared the dataset  
- Trained several different classifiers  
- Compared performance across models (accuracy and possibly other metrics)  
- Examined confusion matrices and misclassifications  
- Reflected on which models performed best and why  

This project encourages deeper thinking about **why** different algorithms behave differently on the same dataset.
