# Project 02 — Classifier Experimentation

Welcome to **Project 02**, where I continue building classification skills by experimenting with different models, preprocessing steps, and evaluation techniques.

## 📄 Overview / Summary

In this project, I:

- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset  
- Compared different classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, k-NN, etc.)  
- Experimented with hyperparameters  
- Evaluated performance using test/train splits  
- Reflected on model behavior and what improved or harmed accuracy  

This project emphasizes iteration, comparison, and understanding each model’s strengths and weaknesses.
