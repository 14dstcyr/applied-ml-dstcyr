# Project 05 — Ensemble Models

Welcome to **Project 05**, where I explore several ensemble learning techniques to improve classification performance.  
Ensemble models combine multiple classifiers to create stronger, more accurate predictions than a single model alone.

## 📄 Overview / Summary

In this project, I:

- Created a baseline classifier  
- Trained several ensemble models, including:
  - AdaBoost  
  - Random Forest  
  - A custom ensemble combining multiple model types  
- Compared model performance on training and test sets  
- Explored visualizations such as decision boundaries  
- Reflected on when and why ensembles outperform individual models

This project demonstrates how combining models can lead to better performance and more robust predictions.
