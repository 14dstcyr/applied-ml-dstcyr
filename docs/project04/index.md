Welcome to **Project 04**, where I shift from classification to **regression modeling**.  
In this project, I explore predicting a continuous numeric target using several regression techniques.

## 📄 Overview / Summary

In this project, I:

- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset  
- Explored relationships between features and the target variable  
- Trained one or more regression models (such as Linear Regression, Ridge, or others)  
- Evaluated model performance using regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², etc.)  
- Reflected on what worked well and what could be improved
