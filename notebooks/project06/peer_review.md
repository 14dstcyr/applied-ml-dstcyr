------------------------------------------------

### Clarity & Organization
Branton’s notebook is well organized and easy to follow. Each section is clearly marked, and the workflow moves logically from data loading to exploration, modeling, and evaluation. The explanations are concise and helpful, and the notebook is visually clean.
One small suggestion would be to add short summaries at the start of major sections to help guide the reader on what to expect next.

-------------------------------------------------

### Feature Selection & Justification
The feature choices are appropriate for predicting medical charges. Branton provided clear justification for including variables like age, BMI, smoker status, and others, which adds credibility to the modeling decisions.
As a possible enhancement, he could mention potential interactions (for example, smoker × age or smoker × BMI) to demonstrate awareness of more complex relationships, even if they weren’t included in the final model.

--------------------------------------------------

### Model Performance & Comparisons
Branton compared multiple models and presented the results clearly using R², MAE, and RMSE. The comparison makes it easy to see how each model performed.
A helpful addition might be a visual diagnostic plot—such as predicted vs. actual charges or a residuals plot—to give a deeper understanding of where the model performs well or struggles.

----------------------------------------------------

### Reflection Quality
The reflections are thoughtful and show a good understanding of the results and the modeling process. Branton clearly communicated what he learned and how different modeling choices impacted performance.
The reflections could be strengthened slightly by adding a brief comment on what he would explore with more time (additional models, new features, etc.).

----------------------------------------------------

### Overall
Branton’s project is well done—clear, organized, and supported with solid explanations. 
The modeling choices make sense, and the results are communicated effectively. Excellent job!
