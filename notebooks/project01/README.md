# Project 01 Pet Adoption Analysis

This folder contains a ready-to-edit Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `D2_Pet_Adoption_Analysis_StCyr.ipynb` — your notebook starter with numbered sections, reflections, and working code cells.
- `README.md` — this file with instructions and tips.
- `m101_fixed.ipynb`- working script with just the code.
## Where to put this in your repo
Place this folder under your course repository at:
```
notebooks/
  project01/
    README.md
    m101.py
    ml01_stcyr.ipynb
```

## How to Run
1. Open your course repo in VS Code.
2. Ensure your Python environment (the same as Project 1) is activated.
3. Open `ml01_stcyr.ipynb` and run cells top-to-bottom.

## What to Edit
- Update the **title block** (name, date) in the first cell as needed.
- Add short **Reflection** answers after each section.
- Improve charts or add more.

## Notes
- The dataset is loaded from `file_path = (
    "/kaggle/input/pet-adoption-records-with-animal-and-adopter-data/pet_adoption_center.csv"
)
