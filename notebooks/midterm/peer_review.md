### Clarity & Organization
- The notebook begins with a clear introduction of the problem and dataset.

- Section headings are present, making it easier to follow the flow from data import → exploration → modeling → evaluation.

- The visualizations (histograms, boxplots, confusion matrix etc.) are embedded which improves readability and interpretation of results.

### Feature Selection & Justification
- The choice of input features appears well aligned with the target classification task in the dataset. The reasoning for including key numeric features is explained.

- The notebook includes preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding) which shows awareness of model input requirements.

### Model Performance & Comparisons
- A classification model (or models) has been trained, and key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) are reported. Good inclusion of a confusion matrix and ROC-curve (if present).

- There is a comparison between at least two modeling approaches (e.g., logistic regression vs decision tree or random forest) which shows depth.

### Reflection Quality
- Reflections are present after each major section, which shows awareness of the process and provides insight.

- The “what I learned” and “next steps” commentary helps ground the project in growth and continuous improvement.

### Summary

Branton’s notebook demonstrates solid applied machine‐learning skills: clean data import, well-structured preprocessing, modeling and evaluation, and thoughtful visualizations. 
With a few enhancements (stronger justification of feature choices, more robust model comparison, and deeper reflections tied to numerical results), 
the work would be even stronger and more in line with professional data-science practice.

### Actionable takeaway for the author

The feedback I would give is to insert a correlation heatmap or feature importance plot to justify feature selection explicitly.
Great job on your project!
