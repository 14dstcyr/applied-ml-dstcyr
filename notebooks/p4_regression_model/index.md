# P4 – Building a Regression Model

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate multiple regression models using the Titanic dataset.  
It follows the structure of the Howell regression example, including multiple feature cases (Case 1–4),  
four different regression models, model evaluation metrics, a summary table, and final reflections.
